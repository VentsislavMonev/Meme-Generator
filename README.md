# 🖼️ Meme Generator

This is a simple meme generator app built with **React** and **Vite** as part of the [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).

The app allows users to:
- Type a **top** and **bottom** text to overlay on a meme image.
- Click a button to display a **random meme image** from a fetched list while keeping the text intact.
